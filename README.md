BlazorSQLExample

This is a personal research/educational project to learn Blazor development using .NET 8. The application has been configured to utilize a SQL Server 2022 instance running from a local Docker container.

I have been using this project to:

- learn the relationships with the Entity Framework.
- learn how to manage web content in autorized/non-authorized scenarios
- design/implement elements with Bootstrap resources
- convert small projects as Blazor components, refactoring the original JavaScript of those projects with C# code and methods instead

Credits to:
- YouTube user BroCode for the original Calculator project used to refactor; I changed a few implementation details and refactored the JavaScript implementation with C# instead.
- YouTube users GreatStack for the original Clock sample used to refactor the JavaScript implementation with C# instead, not to mention Coding Snow for the CSS elements; the Date implementation was my own addition.
- GreatStack was also the inspiration for my Weather component where I also converted the JavaScript to a C# implementation; this replaced the original project sample page that displayed mock data in a table. I added the metric/imperial presentation switch.
- The .NET tutorial series on "Blazor Development for Beginners" for the Movie sample page and base project to work off of. This page was created as presented so that I could follow along with the video series and understand the components
